## 🚀 About Me

I'm currently pursuing my Master's Degree in **Computer Engineering** at Università degli Studi di Salerno, where I graduated *110/110 Cum Laude* for my Bachelor's. I'm passionate about AI and have hands-on experience building smart solutions like a **virtual healthcare assistant** using **Vertex AI** and **LangChain** during my Internship at RiAtlas Srl.

Thanks to my commitment and curiosity, I won the **Iliad STEM Scholarship (2nd Edition)**, earning mentorship from leaders in the tech industry and participating in high-impact workshops around corporate innovation and performance.

I believe in blending **technical depth** with **real-world problem solving**, and I thrive in multilingual, multicultural environments 🌍 (I am fluent in English 🇬🇧 and Italian 🇮🇹... and I speak a bit of Spanish 🇪🇸 too!).
