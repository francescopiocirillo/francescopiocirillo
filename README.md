# 👋 Hi, I'm Francesco Pio Cirillo

🛠️ *AI Engineer in Training* | 🎓 *Master’s in Computer Engineering* | 🏆 *Iliad STEM Scholarship Winner*

Welcome to my personal GitHub showcase! This repository gathers the highlights of my academic, professional, and personal journey into the world of **AI**, **Software Engineering**, and **cutting-edge tech**. Whether you're here as a recruiter, collaborator, or fellow tech enthusiast: I'm glad you're exploring my work!

## 🚀 About Me

I'm currently pursuing my Master's Degree in **Computer Engineering** at Università degli Studi di Salerno, where I graduated *110/110 Cum Laude* for my Bachelor's. I'm passionate about AI and have hands-on experience building smart solutions like a **virtual healthcare assistant** using **Vertex AI** and **LangChain** during my Internship at RiAtlas Srl.

Thanks to my commitment and curiosity, I won the **Iliad STEM Scholarship (2nd Edition)**, earning mentorship from leaders in the tech industry and participating in high-impact workshops around corporate innovation and performance.

I believe in blending **technical depth** with **real-world problem solving**, and I thrive in multilingual, multicultural environments 🌍 (I am fluent in English 🇬🇧 and Italian 🇮🇹... and I speak a bit of Spanish 🇪🇸 too!).
