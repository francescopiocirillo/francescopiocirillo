# 👋 Hi, I'm Francesco Pio Cirillo

🛠️ *AI Engineer in Training* | 🎓 *Master’s in Computer Engineering* | 🏆 *Iliad STEM Scholarship Winner*

Welcome to my personal GitHub showcase! This repository gathers the highlights of my academic, professional, and personal journey into the world of **AI**, **Software Engineering**, and **cutting-edge tech**. Whether you're here as a recruiter, collaborator, or fellow tech enthusiast: I'm glad you're exploring my work!

## 🚀 About Me

I'm currently pursuing my Master's Degree in **Computer Engineering** at Università degli Studi di Salerno, where I graduated *110/110 Cum Laude* for my Bachelor's. I'm passionate about AI and have hands-on experience building smart solutions like a **virtual healthcare assistant** using **Vertex AI** and **LangChain** during my Internship at RiAtlas Srl.

Thanks to my commitment and curiosity, I won the **Iliad STEM Scholarship (2nd Edition)**, earning mentorship from leaders in the tech industry and participating in high-impact workshops around corporate innovation and performance.

I believe in blending **technical depth** with **real-world problem solving**, and I thrive in multilingual, multicultural environments 🌍 (I am fluent in English 🇬🇧 and Italian 🇮🇹... and I speak a bit of Spanish 🇪🇸 too!).

# 📌 Highlighted Projects

Here are some of my favorite repositories you’ll find on my GitHub:

## 🧠 Artificial Intelligence and Data Analysis

### 🤖 [semantic-segmentation-deeplabv3-pytorch](https://github.com/francescopiocirillo/semantic-segmentation-deeplabv3-pytorch)
Comprehensive study & optimization of semantic segmentation models for rural roads. Deep learning semantic segmentation to power computer vision systems for autonomous vehicles in rural environments. PyTorch + CUDA optimized. Evaluated several architectures, achieved 60%+ mIoU with DeepLabV3+ResNet101.

### 📶 [bit-decoding-sgd-logistic-regression](https://github.com/francescopiocirillo/bit-decoding-sgd-logistic-regression)
Logistic regression classifier for bit decoding in binary vectors using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Features performance evaluation, probabilistic modeling, confusion matrix analysis, and classification error interpretation. Developed in Python with Jupyter Notebook.

### 📈 [linear-regression-from-scratch-R](https://github.com/francescopiocirillo/linear-regression-from-scratch-R)
Hands-on regression analysis project in R using a dataset with 30 predictors. Includes manual OLS implementation without lm(), p-value computation, and comparison with built-in functions. Applies stepwise selection (AIC/BIC), Ridge, and Lasso to minimize test error and identify key predictors.

## 💻 Software Engineering

### 🎨 [draw-snap-drawing-tool](https://github.com/francescopiocirillo/draw-snap-drawing-tool)
DrawSnap is a **Java-based** geometric drawing tool built with **Scrum methodology**. It supports creating and editing shapes (lines, rectangles, ellipses, polygons, text), grouping, custom shape libraries, and advanced editing features like rotation, mirroring, and unlimited undo.

### 🧮 [java-rpn-scientific-calculator](https://github.com/francescopiocirillo/java-rpn-scientific-calculator)
A fully-featured **Java** Scientific Calculator based on Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) and advanced stack operations, developed with a GUI, JUnit testing, and UML planning. Built as part of a university software engineering project using the **Waterfall model** and producing ample documentation also, but not only, using **UML diagrams**.

## 📲 Front-end development

### 🍝 [flying-sauce-r](https://github.com/francescopiocirillo/flying-sauce-r)
A pasta delivery app with a twist, designed as a fun, functional PHP project with backend logic and UI considerations.

### 📅 [event-manager-flutter-app](https://github.com/francescopiocirillo/event-manager-flutter-app)
A cross-platform mobile app to track and manage events. Developed with Dart and Flutter. Built as part of a 3-month university project by a 2-person team, it features local data persistence with SQLite, responsive UI, customizable statistics, and a clear dashboard to track upcoming and past events.
